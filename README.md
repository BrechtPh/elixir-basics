## Credit

Thanks to [Frederic Vogels](https://github.com/fvogels) for all the effort in creating these exercises. Due to restructuring, the commits are no longer in the commit log, but will not be forgotten.

These exercises were originally created for the course Distributed Applications / Internet Programming major at [UCLL](https://www.ucll.be/). Most of this content is thus sponsored by UCLL.

An extra thanks for every contributor, student and the Elixir community.
